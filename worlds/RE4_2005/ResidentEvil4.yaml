# A few notes for intended gameplay:
# - Items found in game cannot be used or sold until you are sent them. This includes herbs and first aid sprays.
# - You are given the Handgun to start with. Purchasing a weapon from the Merchant (or finding one during exploration) is meant to be unusable until you have been sent it.

  progression_balancing:
    # A system that can move progression earlier, to try and prevent the player from getting stuck and bored early.
    #
    # To set a custom progression balance, change the '0' in the first option to your preference. (i.e. for a progression balance of 35, it should look like "35: 50")
    #
    # A lower setting means more getting stuck. A higher setting means less getting stuck.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 99
